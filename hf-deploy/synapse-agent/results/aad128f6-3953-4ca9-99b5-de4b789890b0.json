      "reasoning": "Gaoxiang's profile shows experience at Google, a top tech company, which significantly boosts his company relevance score.  His work on improving developer productivity with AI aligns well with the job description, earning a solid skills match score. However, the education details are unclear and incomplete, resulting in a lower education score.  The career trajectory shows some progression but lacks specifics on tenure and promotions, leading to a moderate score.  The location is a perfect match.  The limited information on tenure results in a low score in that category. Overall, Gaoxiang's profile demonstrates potential, but more detailed information is needed to assess his fit fully.",

      "reasoning": "Casey's profile shows a strong foundation in software engineering and machine learning.  His education at Georgia Tech's OMSCS program specializing in Machine Learning is a positive indicator. His experience at Microsoft, while not directly related to LLM training, demonstrates relevant software engineering skills. However, the lack of explicit experience training large production neural networks and the absence of location information lowers the score. The provided experience descriptions are vague, making it difficult to assess career trajectory and tenure accurately.",
