# üìù LinkedIn Sourcing Agent - Project Summary

**Built for the Synapse AI Hackathon**

## üéØ Project Overview

The LinkedIn Sourcing Agent is an autonomous AI-powered recruitment system that automates the complete candidate sourcing pipeline: from job description input to personalized outreach generation. It combines Google Custom Search, LinkedIn profile scraping, and AI-powered candidate analysis to deliver ranked candidates with fit scores and personalized connection messages.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Approach

### **Architecture Decision: End-to-End Automation**
Rather than building separate tools, I designed a cohesive agent that handles the entire sourcing workflow autonomously. The system uses a pipeline approach where each stage feeds seamlessly into the next.

### **Core Components:**

1. **Search Query Generation**: Uses Gemini LLM to distill job descriptions into effective Google search queries
2. **Profile Discovery**: Google Custom Search API finds LinkedIn profiles with high precision  
3. **Data Extraction**: Playwright-based scraper handles LinkedIn's dynamic content and authentication
4. **AI Analysis**: Single comprehensive LLM call scores candidates using the exact hackathon rubric
5. **Result Management**: JSON-based storage with unique job IDs for result retrieval

### **Technology Stack Rationale:**
- **FastAPI**: Chosen for async support, automatic API documentation, and production readiness
- **Playwright**: More reliable than Selenium for modern web scraping, better JavaScript handling
- **Google Gemini**: Latest LLM with JSON output support, faster than GPT-4 for structured analysis
- **Google Custom Search**: More reliable than SerpAPI, better LinkedIn profile discovery

### **Key Technical Innovations:**

**1. Windows Asyncio Compatibility**
```python
# Fixed Windows subprocess issues with proper event loop policy
if sys.platform == "win32":
    asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(asyncio.WindowsProactorEventLoopPolicy())
```

**2. Threaded Playwright Execution** 
```python
# Prevents blocking the FastAPI event loop
def run_in_new_loop():
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    return loop.run_until_complete(scraping_task)
```

**3. Structured LLM Output**
```python
# Ensures consistent JSON responses from Gemini
config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
    temperature=0.2,
    response_mime_type="application/json"
)
```

## üöß Challenges Faced & Solutions

### **Challenge 1: LinkedIn Anti-Bot Detection**
**Problem**: LinkedIn aggressively blocks automated scraping attempts.
**Solution**: 
- Implemented session cookie authentication using real browser sessions
- Added intelligent delays between requests (2-3 seconds)
- Used Playwright with real browser fingerprints instead of headless detection
- Graceful fallback handling when profiles are inaccessible

### **Challenge 2: Windows Development Environment**
**Problem**: Playwright and asyncio have compatibility issues on Windows.
**Solution**:
- Implemented Windows-specific asyncio event loop policy
- Used ThreadPoolExecutor to isolate Playwright operations
- Added comprehensive error handling for subprocess creation

### **Challenge 3: Inconsistent LinkedIn Profile Data**
**Problem**: LinkedIn profiles have varying data completeness and formats.
**Solution**:
- Designed flexible scraping logic that handles missing sections
- Implemented confidence scoring based on data completeness
- Created fallback analysis when profile data is minimal
- Used multiple selectors for robust data extraction

### **Challenge 4: AI Scoring Consistency**
**Problem**: Ensuring LLM scoring follows the exact hackathon rubric consistently.
**Solution**:
- Created detailed prompts with specific scoring guidelines
- Used JSON mode for structured output
- Implemented weighted scoring that exactly matches rubric percentages
- Added multiple fallback mechanisms for LLM failures

### **Challenge 5: Real-Time Demo Requirements**
**Problem**: Need immediate results for demos vs. background processing for scale.
**Solution**:
- Built both synchronous (`/run-sourcing-job-sync/`) and asynchronous endpoints
- Added real-time progress indicators in web interface
- Implemented job result storage and retrieval system
- Created beautiful web UI for live demonstrations

## üöÄ Scaling to 100s of Jobs

### **Current Architecture (Single Instance)**
- **Capacity**: 10-50 candidates per job, 1-3 concurrent jobs
- **Storage**: JSON files with unique job IDs
- **Processing**: Single-threaded with rate limiting
- **Bottlenecks**: LinkedIn rate limits, single Playwright instance

### **Scaling Strategy: Distributed Architecture**

**1. Horizontal Scaling - Multiple Worker Instances**
```python
# Deploy multiple API servers behind load balancer
# Each instance handles subset of jobs
nginx -> [API Server 1, API Server 2, API Server 3, ...]
```

**2. Queue-Based Job Management**
```python
# Replace direct processing with job queue
Redis/RabbitMQ -> Worker Pool -> Results Database
```

**3. Database Layer**
```python
# Replace JSON files with proper database
PostgreSQL/MongoDB for job storage
Redis for caching profile data
Elasticsearch for candidate search
```

**4. Profile Data Caching**
```python
# Cache scraped profiles to avoid re-scraping
profile_cache = {
    "linkedin_url": profile_data,
    "last_updated": timestamp,
    "expiry": 7_days
}
```

**5. Distributed Scraping**
```python
# Multiple browser instances across machines
browser_pool = [
    BrowserInstance(proxy_1, session_1),
    BrowserInstance(proxy_2, session_2),
    BrowserInstance(proxy_3, session_3)
]
```

### **Projected Scale Performance:**

| Component | Current | Scaled (100s jobs) |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Concurrent Jobs** | 1-3 | 50-100 |
| **Daily Candidates** | 100-500 | 10,000-50,000 |
| **Job Completion** | 2-5 minutes | 30-60 seconds |
| **Success Rate** | 80-90% | 85-95% (better caching) |
| **Infrastructure** | Single server | 5-10 servers + caching |

### **Implementation Roadmap:**

**Phase 1: Queue System (Week 1)**
- Add Redis job queue
- Implement worker processes
- Database migration from JSON

**Phase 2: Caching Layer (Week 2)**  
- Profile data caching
- Search result caching
- API response caching

**Phase 3: Browser Pool (Week 3)**
- Multiple Playwright instances
- Proxy rotation
- Session management

**Phase 4: Monitoring & Analytics (Week 4)**
- Performance metrics
- Success rate tracking
- Cost optimization
